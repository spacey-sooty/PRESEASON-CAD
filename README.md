# Advanced CAD Preseason
My notes for preseason CAD class

## Naming Scheme
Parts: T4788-SUB-001-NAME  
Assembly: T4788-SUB-A-NAME  

## Gear Generators

### What Defines a gear?
- module (size of teeth)
- number of teeth
- diametrical pitch (reciprocal of module)

### Guidelines
- Don't generally care about center distance.  
- use export teeth and create a seperate part for a gear

## Belt and Tooth Calculations
- we generally use htd (high torque drive) hdd5 with a pitch of 5 millimetres
- pitch measurement is taken in the pitch circle
- pitch circle is the pitch multiplied by the number of teetb
- teeth on belt = cd * 2 / 5 + teethpulley
- use west coast products belt calculator site
- inventor also can do a ton of stuff for you
